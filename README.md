# Jet Bracket Dynamics Simulation (MATLAB + Simulink)

This project simulates the dynamic response of a jet engine bracket modeled as a springâ€“massâ€“damper system using Simulink and MATLAB.

## ðŸ”§ Whatâ€™s Included
- Parametric simulation with:
  - Mass = 2.22 kg
  - Stiffness = 20000 N/m
  - Damping = 66.6 Ns/m
- External Force: 100 N sinusoidal at 20 Hz
- MATLAB code to plot Position and Velocity

## ðŸ“ˆ Outputs
- Time-domain response plot
- Simulink block model

## ðŸš€ Motivation
This work is part of my larger project to build a **component-level digital twin** using Fusion 360 (geometry + FEA) and Simulink (dynamics). The mass value was derived from parametric simulation in Fusion 360.

## ðŸ’» Tools Used
- MATLAB 2023b
- Simulink
- Fusion 360 (for geometry/mass)
